# US-census-income-report
This is a project to build a model which can accurately identifies whether a person in the survey has income more than 50,000 USD or not.
I have done some feature engineering and data visualisation to make a better sense of the data and for making a better input for the model.

# Motivation
As my skill set as a data scientist was becoming better, I wanted to apply it on a little harder dataset. That's when I find this dataset which was kind of intermeddiate level.
This one was more of a classification problem and it had been a while since I did any classification problem.

# Objective
The objective of the project was simple, we have to make a model which can predict whether a person has income greater than 50K annualy or not.
I also had to make sure my kernel was easy to understand so I added lots of graphs in it.

# Conclusion
Logistic Regression gives the best outcome with an accuracy of nearly 84% in predicting the outcome.
