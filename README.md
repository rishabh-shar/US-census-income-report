# US-census-income-report
This is a project to build a model which can accurately identifies whether a person in the survey has income more than 50,000 USD or not.
I have done some feature engineering and data visualisation to make a better sense of the data and for making a better input for the model.

# Conclusion
Logistic Regression gives the best outcome with an accuracy of 84% in predicting the outcome.
